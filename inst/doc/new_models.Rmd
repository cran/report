## 1. Open an Issue on GitHub

If there is a model that you would like to report but is not currently supported
in `report`, you can suggest it to us. You can do so by opening an issue on
[https://github.com/easystats/report/issues](https://github.com/easystats/report/issues),
and saying what would you like to see, and how you can eventually help out (e.g., you can help us test the new functionality).

## 2. Use template file

Copy and paste the [**template file**](https://github.com/easystats/report/blob/master/R/report.default.R), and replace the function with the one you would like to see supported.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(old_options)  # Restore options
```
