\title{Reporting the participant data}
\usage{
report_participants(
  data,
  age = NULL,
  sex = NULL,
  education = NULL,
  participants = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  spell_n = FALSE,
  digits = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{age}{The name of the column containing the age of the participant.}

\item{sex}{The name of the column containing the sex of the participant. The
classes should be one of \code{c("Male", "M", "Female", "F")}. Note that
you can specify other characters here as well (e.g., \code{"Other"}), but
the function will report only percentage of females, regardless of whether
any category other than "Male" is present in the data.}

\item{education}{The name of the column containing education information.}

\item{participants}{The name of the participants' identifier column (for
instance in the case of repeated measures).}

\item{group}{A character vector indicating the name(s) of the column(s) used
for stratified description.}

\item{spell_n}{Fully spell the sample size (\code{"Three participants"}
instead of \code{"3 participants"}).}

\item{digits}{Number of significant digits.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A character vector with description of the "participants", based on
the information provided in \code{data}.
}
\description{
A helper function to help you format the participants data (age, sex, ...) in
the participants section.
